                <span class="big">I</span> know this is kind of sudden, but, please, it will only take a moment. I
                want your honest opinion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Are people equal or not?
            </p>
            <p>
                A proper society will constantly strive for equality. There are those
                who clamor for men and women to always be considered equal. As a result,
                we raised the employment rate for women, we made specialized subway cars
                only for women. Sometimes, women will even argue over the order of names
                in a family register. The public opinion of people with disabilities has also
                changed. We’re now told that we should not use the term “disabled people”
                when referring to them, so as not to discriminate. Nowadays, children are
                taught that all people are created equal.
            </p>
            <p>
                But is that true? I have my doubts. If men and women have different
                abilities, then their roles should also differ. People with disabilities are still
                disabled, no matter what polite euphemisms you use. No matter how you try
                to avert your eyes, the meaning of the word does not change.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, my answer would be, “No, we are not equal.” To be human is to be
                unequal. Equality does not exist.
            </p>
            <p>
                Long ago, in a bygone era, a great man said that heaven does not set
                one man above or below any other. However, he did not necessarily adhere to
                the idea that everyone is equal. Did you know that there is more to that
                famous passage? The rest goes like this: Everyone is equal when they are
                born, so I ask, why do we see differences in position and status?And it
                continues: 
                    Do you or do you not encourage learning to create a difference?
                
                So then, education creates an imbalance. The point’s spelled out there, in the
                incredibly famous work Gakumon no Sume. Even though this is the year
                2015, the modern era, nothing about these teachings has changed. The
                situation has only grown more complex and fraught.
            </p>
            <p>
                In any case, we are human beings. We are living, thinking creatures.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t think it right to simply say that we are unequal and then live our
                lives based on pure instinct. In other words, though “equality” is a complete
                lie, we cannot accept inequality, either. Right now, I’m trying to come up
                with a new answer for humanity’s eternal question.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hey, you there. You, the one reading this book right now. Have you
                ever given serious thought to the future?
            </p>
            <p>
                Have you ever considered the purpose of going to high school or to
                college? Though the future may seem hazy right now, do you think you’ll
                find a job someday? That’s what I used to think. Back when I finished my
                compulsory education and became a high school student, I hadn’t really
                considered the future. I’d only felt joy at being nearly free of obligation. I
                didn’t consider the incredible influence that school would continue to have in
                my life, on my future. I didn’t even understand the purpose behind studying
                language or numbers.
